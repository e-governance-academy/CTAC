## Introduction to CTAC

The problem of corruption is recognized as one of the biggest challenges in any country. It is also regarded as something abstract and distant from everyday lives of citizens, who do not relate to corruption and neither see it affecting their welfare and quality of life. One of the reasons is the limited awareness and understanding of its ramifications and effects. An effective call to action against corruption is based on the gradual education, raising awareness and mobilizing people in condemning corruption to a larger scale and extent.

The platform has following objectives:
* **The educative objective:** The platform provide the general information about different forms of corruption and
enable the citizens to advance their knowledge on corruption.
* **The mobilizing objective:** The platform smobilize the online community who contribute to crowdsourcing descriptions
of situations favorable for corruption.
* **The advocating objective:** The platform provide the space for dissemination of advocacy activities.
* **The community-building objective:** The platform enable a user to join the community of people interested in anticorruption
activities and to receive the information related to this area.

The platform has fourmain functionalities accessible by pressing buttons: **“LEARN”, “TEST“, “REPORT“, “BE INVOLVED“** (NB! the titles are subject to change). These press buttons should lead to the main modules of the platform, described below. In addition to this functionalities, the homepage should display:
*	newsfeed and news archive about advocacy activities;
*	project- and platform-related information with logos of partners (eGA and CPR) and funding institutions (OSI and MFA of Estonia);
